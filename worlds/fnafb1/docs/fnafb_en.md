## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

you can customize your options by visiting the [Five Nights at Fuckboy's Options Page](/games/Five%20Nights%20at%20Fuckboy%27s/player-options).

### Connect to the MultiServer

In the mkxp.json found within the main install, enter the server, port, and your slot name.
Save the file and open Start Game.bat. The game will connect after the newspaper fades.
Your connection info will save to your save data.
